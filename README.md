# Interactive Physics Animations in Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains an interactive Jupyter notebook that demonstrates various physics concepts through animations. It allows users to explore and visualize fundamental principles of physics in a dynamic and engaging way. 

### Requirements:
To run the notebook locally, you'll need:
- **Python 3.12**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Voila** (to run the notebook as a web app)
  
You can install the required dependencies for each folder's "requirement.txt" file using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
  
2. Open the notebook using **Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. To run the notebook as an interactive web app with **Voila**, use the following command:
   ```
   voila notebook_name.ipynb
   ```
   Some notebooks may rely on Jupyter notebook extensions for additional interactivity or custom widgets, for that run the following command:
   ```
   voila --enable_nbextensions=True your_notebook.ipynb
   ```
5. Explore the physics animations and experiment with different parameters in the web interface.
